Non-Disclosure Obligations
COMPANY possesses and considers to be proprietary and confidential certain information, 
drawings, data, software, documentation, business plans and know-how relating to technology 
owned by COMPANY (all such confidential information, drawings, data, software, documentation, 
business plans and know-how are hereinafter referred to as “CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION”). It 
is understood that STUDENT and COMPANY are both interested in having STUDENT receive 
access to such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for the sole purpose of working on PROJECT. 
Because such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION is proprietary and confidential to COMPANY, and to 
provide an appropriate basis by which such CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION can be made available 
to STUDENT, the parties agree to the following terms and provisions:
1. STUDENT will treat as confidential, and not disclose to any other person outside of COURSE or 
COMPANY, all CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which is or has been made available, directly or 
indirectly, to STUDENT, and will treat it with the same degree of care that it would treat 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of its own.
2. STUDENT agrees to only use CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for PROJECT and not for any 
other purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial.
3. STUDENT agrees not to make any copies of CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION unless STUDENT 
has written permission from COMPANY.
4. The non-disclosure obligations of STUDENT under this agreement do not apply to 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which: (a) at the time of the disclosure is generally available 
to the public or thereafter becomes generally available to the public through no act or 
omission of STUDENT; or (b) STUDENT can show by written records to have been in 
STUDENT’s possession prior to the time of the disclosure and was not acquired, directly or 
indirectly, from COMPANY; or (c) STUDENT can show by written records to have been 
independently made available as a matter of right to STUDENT by others, provided such others 
did not acquire CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION directly or indirectly from COMPANY.
Furthermore, STUDENT may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to an order of a court 
or governmental agency, provided that STUDENT first uses reasonable efforts to provide 
COMPANY with advance notice to permit COMPANY to seek a protective order or otherwise 
restrict the disclosure of the Confidential Information.
